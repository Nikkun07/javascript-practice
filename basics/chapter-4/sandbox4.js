const name = 'Nikkun';

//Functions 

const greet = () => 'Hello';

let result1 = greet ();

//Methods

let result2 = name.toUpperCase();

//Difference of Function from Methods is the way of how you invoke them.
//Methods are functions. They're associated with an object or a data type.
//Functions are defined on their own.
